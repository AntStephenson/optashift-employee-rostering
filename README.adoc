. https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-171158[IntelliJ does not support the new GWT plugin yet]
. Create a new JBoss run configuration to a local WildFly instance:
.. In the _Before launch_ list, remove `Make project`
.. In the _Before launch_ list, add `Run Maven goal` on the root pom with arguments `clean install -Dgwt.draftCompile`
.. In the _Deployment_ tab, in _Deploy at startup_, add `optashift-employee-rostering-webapp:war exploded`.
